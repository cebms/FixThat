# FixThat
Application to connect workers to clients who need home services

* This application was developed as a training for some new technologies I have been studying
* Its objective is to work as a platform on which workers can add their services if they work on
  specific areas, typically known as house services, such as Masonry, Electrics, Hydraulics and Painting;
  
## To start the project:
 * Run `npm install` to download all the dependencies required;
 * Run `npm start` to start running the project;
 * By default, the port used is 3333, so the URL should be `http://localhost:3333`

## Technologies used:
* HTML and CSS for pages organization and styles;
* EJS for pages rendering and template creation;
* Node.js + Express for backend structure and dealing with HTTP requests from the client;
* SQLite and SQLite3 packages for Node.js in order to create and connect to the database;
* TypeScript as main backend language;

## Features:
* One can create their account and receive a login code (for now, it is random and cannot be retrieved in case of
  lost or if the user forgets);
* Once a user account is created, it is possible to use their login and password to add a new Job to the platform,
  filling the form with the required information, such as title, description and contact;
* When the form is submitted, the information is stored in tyhe database and the inserted job is now visible on the main
  page as a card with all the information sent;
* It is also possible to use that login and password to view active jobs on the platform in order to delete them individually;

## Future implementations:
* Add logic to retrieve user password and login in case of loss;
* Make possible to create a custom login id, so it is not randomly generated by the system;
* In the EJS files, delete some views that are alike and add its differences to a 'parts' folder,
  rendering these parts conditionally;
